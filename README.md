# RAGChatbot

**Project Description**:

This project focuses on building a chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the capabilities of a standard language model. The chatbot initially lacks access to recent information, making it unable to respond to queries about newer topics like Llama 2. By integrating external data sources and a vector database, the project augments the language model, enabling it to retrieve and utilize up-to-date information effectively. The core aim is to bridge the gap between traditional LLMs and real-time, relevant data, thereby improving the chatbot's performance and accuracy in answering user queries.
